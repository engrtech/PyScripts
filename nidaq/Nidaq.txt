Used a USB-6008 for the USI Over-voltage tester. User-guide is included in this repository.

Dev1 is used as default, but this can be changed as needed.

Multiple samples are needed for AI and DI.
Currently using the max() function in python, but might need to test this for values when all the AI and DI samples are different.
